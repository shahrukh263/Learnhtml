# 1. p tag

The `<p>` tag is an HTML element used to create paragraphs in a web page. It represents a block of text or content that forms a self-contained unit or thought. When the browser renders the HTML document, paragraphs are typically visually separated by space (line breaks) from adjacent paragraphs, creating a clear visual distinction between them.

Here's how the `<p>` tag is used:

```
<p>This is a paragraph of text. It represents a self-contained unit of content within the HTML document.</p>
```
