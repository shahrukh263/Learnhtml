# 1. h1 to h6 tag
In HTML, the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags are used to create headings with varying levels of importance and hierarchy. The `<h1>` tag represents the highest level of heading and is typically used for the main title or heading of the page, while the `<h6>` tag represents the lowest level of heading, used for subheadings or less important content.

Here's how the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags are used:

1. `<h1>`: Main Heading (highest level)

```
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
```

2. `<h2>`: Subheading Level 1

```
<h2>This is a Subheading Level 1</h2>
```

3. `<h3>`: Subheading Level 2

```
<h3>This is a Subheading Level 2</h3>
```

4. `<h4>`: Subheading Level 3

```
<h4>This is a Subheading Level 3</h4>
```

5. `<h5>`: Subheading Level 4

```
<h5>This is a Subheading Level 4</h5>
```

6. `<h6>`: Subheading Level 5 (lowest level)

```
<h6>This is a Subheading Level 5</h6>
```

When using headings, it's essential to use them semantically to convey the structure and hierarchy of the content on the page. Search engines and screen readers rely on these semantic tags to understand the page's content properly. It is recommended to use `<h1>` for the main title and then use subsequent headings in descending order to represent the page's content hierarchy logically.
