# 1. b tag
In HTML, the `<b>` tag is used to define text that should be displayed in a bold or stronger font weight. It is a presentational tag that visually makes the enclosed text bold without implying any specific semantic meaning to the content.

Here's the basic syntax of the `<b>` tag:
```
<b>Text to be bold</b>
```


# 2. strong tag
The `<strong>` tag is an HTML element used to indicate strong emphasis on text. It renders the enclosed content with a strong importance, making it appear bold by default in most browsers. The `<strong>` tag is used to convey importance or urgency, and it should not be used solely for styling purposes.

Here's how the `<strong>` tag is used:

```
<p>  This is a <strong>very important</strong> message.</p>
```
