Metadata is typically placed within the `<head>` element of an HTML document.

Here are some common uses of the `<meta>` tag:

1. Character Encoding:

```
html<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
The `charset` attribute specifies the character encoding used in the document. UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that supports a wide range of characters from various languages.

2. Viewport for Responsive Web Design:

```
html<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

The `viewport` meta tag is crucial for responsive web design. It helps control the viewport's dimensions on different devices, ensuring that the web page scales appropriately and fits the user's screen size.

3. Document Description (for SEO):

html<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page's content.">
```
The `description` meta tag provides a brief summary or description of the page's content. Search engines may use this description in search results to provide more context about the page.

4. Keywords (for SEO, not as widely used):

```
html<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
```
The `keywords` meta tag used to be more common for SEO purposes, but search engines nowadays rely more on the actual content of the page to determine its relevance.

5. Page Refresh/Redirect:

```
html<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;url=https://example.com">
```
The `http-equiv` attribute can be used to mimic HTTP response headers. The above example will redirect the page to "https://example.com" after a delay of 5 seconds.

The `<param>` tag is an HTML element that was historically used to specify parameters for a `<object>` element when embedding certain types of multimedia content, such as plugins or applets, into a web page. It was primarily used for older technologies like Java applets and Flash, which required additional configuration through parameters.

However, with the decline of plugins and the advent of modern web technologies, the use of the `<param>` tag has become less common. Nowadays, most multimedia content is embedded using more standard and supported methods, like `<video>` and `<audio>` elements for media playback, or using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas for interactive content.

Here's an example of how the `<param>` tag used to be used for embedding a Flash object (not recommended for modern web development):

```
<object data="flashfile.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">

# 55. s tag
As of my last update in September 2021, there is no standard HTML element called `<s>` that is used for any specific purpose. However, there is a deprecated HTML element called `<s>` that was used to represent strikethrough text. The strikethrough text has a line drawn through it to indicate that the content is no longer valid or has been deleted.

While the `<s>` element was part of older HTML specifications, it is no longer recommended for use, and its usage has been deprecated in favor of using CSS to style text. Instead of using the `<s>` tag, it is best to use CSS styles to apply strikethrough to text.
