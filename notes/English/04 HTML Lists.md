# 1. li tag

The `<li>` tag is an HTML element used to create individual items in an ordered (<`ol`>) or unordered (`<ul>`) list. It stands for "list item."

Here's how the `<li>` tag is used:

```
<ul>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
<li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>First Item</li>
<li>Second Item</li>
<li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
```


# 2. dl tag

The `<dl>` tag in HTML is used to create a description list. It is a block-level element that represents a list of term-definition pairs, where each term is represented by the `<dt>` (definition term) tag, and each definition is represented by the `<dd>` (definition description) tag.

Here's the basic syntax of the `<dl>` tag:

```
<dl>
<dt>Term 1</dt>
<dd>Description 1</dd>
<dt>Term 2</dt>
<dd>Description 2</dd>
<!-- More terms and descriptions go here -->
</dl>
```

# 3. ol tag
The `<ol>` tag is an HTML element used to create an ordered list in a web page. It represents a list of items where each item is numbered sequentially. The numbers in the list are typically displayed as 1, 2, 3, and so on, by default.

Here's how the `<ol>` tag is used:

```
<ol><li>First item</li><li>Second item</li><li>Third item</li></ol>
```
